remaining upgrade tasks:

++missing scanned data: OldLeapHandControllerData.extraChildTransforms
    Child transforms of the old LHC transform should be moved to the camera, not deleted! So we need to track them in the scanned data.

- Performing the upgrade:

TOP:
To be safe, you should make sure you've backed up your scene or you're at least running some version control!
[Upgrade All in Current Scene] (This operation can be undone.)
  
  (1) Rig transform
    This transform is the root of the detected rig and does not need to be modified.

  (2) Camera transform
    if (camera_missingScripts.Count > 0) {
      N missing script(s) were found on this rig. Some of them may correspond to scripts that have been deprecated since Core 4.4.
      [x] Remove missing scripts on this object.
      [ ] Don't remove missing scripts on this object.
    }

    if (camera_enableDepthBuffer != null) {
      The EnableDepthBuffer script used to be a part of Leap cameras by default but can cause shader issues in certain situations. If you're not sure you need this component, you should remove it.
      [x] Remove the EnableDepthBuffer script from the camera.
      [ ] Don't remove the EnableDepthBuffer script, I'm using it for something.
    }

    if (imageRig) {
      if (rightEyeCameraTransform != null) {
        // Note: we detect right eye transforms via a LeapEyeDislocator component on them
        Right eye transform: [object field]
        Separate cameras for the left and right eyes is no longer necessary for image pass-through rigs.
        [x] Remove this camera object.
        [ ] Don't remove this camera object.
      }
    }
    else {
      if (leapEyeDislocator != null) {
        LeapEyeDislocator was found on this rig, but it was not detected to be an image pass-through rig. LeapEyeDislocator is not necessary on standard XR rigs.
        [x] Remove LeapEyeDislocator.
        [ ] Don't remove LeapEyeDislocator.
      }
    }

  (3) (old) LeapSpace transform
    The LeapSpace transform and its temporal warping functionality have been migrated into the LeapXRServiceProvider for XR rigs.

    if (leapSpace_missingScripts.Count > 0) {
      N missing script(s) were found on this rig. Some of them may correspond to scripts that have been deprecated since Core 4.4.
      [x] Remove missing scripts on this object.
      [ ] Don't remove missing scripts on this object.
    }

    if (leapSpace_nonLHCChildren.Count > 0) {
      N transforms are attached as children to the LeapSpace object, which is deprecated and will be removed.
      [x] Move these scripts to be children of the Camera.
      [ ] Remove these scripts.
    }

  (4) (old) LeapHandController transform
    The LeapHandController transform and its LeapHandController, LeapServiceProvider, and HandPool components have been simplified.

    The LeapServiceProvider will be removed. In its place, a LeapXRServiceProvider will be added directly to the Camera. The LeapXRServiceProvider handles temporal warping (latency correction) automatically for XR rigs. Applicable settings will be transferred to the LeapXRServiceProvider.

    The HandPool and HandController objects have been combined into a single HandModelManager script, which has been moved to rest on the parent of hand models. This clarifies its separation from the hand data pipeline as one of (potentially many) consumers of hand data from a device.

    if (handModelParent != null) {
      The HandModelManager will be moved to the {handModelParent.name} object.
    }
    else {
      No HandModelBases were found in this rig, so there is no obvious hand model parent.
      [x] A new sibling of the Camera transform will be created; this empty Transform will receive the HandModelManager.
      [ ] Don't set up a HandModelManager.
    }
    
    if (lhc_missingScripts.Count > 0) {
      N missing script(s) were found on this rig. Some of them may correspond to scripts that have been deprecated since Core 4.4.
      [x] Remove missing scripts on this object.
      [ ] Don't remove missing scripts on this object.
    }

    if (lhc_extraChildren.Count > 0) {
      N transforms are attached as children to the LeapHandController object, which is deprecated and will be removed.
      [x] Move these scripts to be children of the Camera.
      [ ] Remove these scripts.
